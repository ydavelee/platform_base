# platform_base
Custom Platform for Management of Vehicle related data, HAM related data, CoSpend related data, Food Recipes and more.

This is basically a test at building a Platform/System with help of ChatGPT.  A test at how good and how secure of a coder ChatGPT is.

The platform will aim to protect against CSRF and XSS, SQL Injection and MITM attacks for a custom CMS aimed at managing data such as:

Home Inventory
Co-Spending
Vehicle Management (Sort of a Vehicle Log)
Food Recipe management subsite (inspired by Allrecipes, Recipes module of Nextcloud, etc)
HAM radio contact logs.
Personal Budgeting info.
Blog
Forums

Of course there are better utilized Open Source Software solutions out there, but they also come with security risks that I am not too keen on.  (Word Press and Drupal)
